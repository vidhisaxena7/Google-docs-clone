# Google-docs-clone
A google docs clone allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating with others in real time. 
It is a free Web-based application where a user can import, create, edit and update documents and spreadsheets in various fonts and file formats, combining text with formulas, lists, tables and images.  Even better, multiple people can work at the same time, we can see people’s changes as they make them, and every change is saved automatically.
